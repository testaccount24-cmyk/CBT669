ISPF exit 1 - make dynamic panels from REXX stem(s)

Current build: 006  2022-09-17

Description

 This ISPF panel exit is used to insert records into an ISPF panel.
 It can replace the entire panel, or one or more sections
 with data in REXX stem variable(s).
 Note that the )END statement must still be present in the panel.

 The exit looks for a line starting with '*ISPDPX01 vname' in the
 panel, then inserts the entire stem vname there.

 When using specific stemname
  The vname must include the trailing dot, max width incl the dot
  is 115 characters.

 When using indirect stemname
  The vname must be inclosed in paranthesis, or start with an
  ampersand, and must be a variable name of 1-115 characters.
  The stemname  must include the trailing dot, max width incl the
  dot is 115 characters.

 Multiple occurences of '*ISPDPX01 vname' is allowed, see member
 ISX1PNL2 for a sample.

 Sample panel using specific stemname, named TESTX001:

  )INEXIT LOAD,ISPDPX01
  *ISPDPX01 pl.
  )END

  Sample REXX code for panel:

  pl.1 = ')ATTR'
  pl.2 = ')BODY expand(\\)'
  pl.3 = '%Test panel exit 1'
  pl.4 = '%Cmd =>_zcmd  \ \ +'
  pl.5 = '+'
  pl.6 = 'Just some text'
  pl.7 = '+'
  pl.8 = ')INIT'
  pl.9 = ')PROC'
  pl.0 = 9
  address ispexec "display panel(TESTX001)"

 Sample panel using indirect stemname, named TESTX002:

  )INEXIT LOAD,ISPDPX01
  *ISPDPX01 &pnlstem
  )END

  Sample REXX code for panel:

  Populate stem pl. as above....
  pnlstem='pl.'
  address ispexec "display panel(TESTX002)"

 ISPDPX01 can be run as REXX function to return version or to copy the
 stack to a stem.
 Syntax:
  ver=ISPDPX01('version')
  rc =ISPDPX01('Q2S stemname.')
   Parameter Q2S is case insensitive.
   stemname must end with a dot (.)
   rc = 0   Ok
   rc = 4   Empty stack
   rc = 8   Parameter error, i.e. missing stemname.
   rc = 12  Parameter error bad command.

 Sample stack-to-stem
  queue  ')ATTR'
  queue  ')BODY expand(\\)'
  queue  '%Test panel exit 1'
    . . .
  cc =ISPDPX01('Q2S pl.')

 The program is written using my structured assembly macro set WSAM.
 These macros are similar but not identical to IBM's structured
 assembly macros.

Members in the dataset:

 ISPDPX01  Source - assemble and link.
 ISX1DOC   Documentation (you are reading it now).
 ISX1MACS  Macro copy book.
 ISX1IVP1  Verification pgm.
 ISX1PNL*  Sample panels etc.

Installation notes:

 If the assembly fails for enhanced immediate instruction, i.e. LGFI,
 then remove the asterix in front of 'COPY  Z10MACS' and reassemble.
