Getting started

 Start by reading the RXPIINTR (Tutorial / introduction) member, then
 continue with the the RXPIDOC member, which is the product and
 command reference.

 See the RXPIDEMO member for a couple of examples. They are packaged
 to run in batch job member RXPIDEM$, but will run equally fine from
 ISPF 6 or TSO READY, though you must set the DEMOLIB variable at the
 top before you do.
