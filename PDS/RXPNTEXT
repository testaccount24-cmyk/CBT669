Doctor Who is a British science-fiction
television programme produced by the BBC from 1963 to the
present day. The programme depicts the adventures of the
Doctor, a Time Lord
a time-travelling humanoid alien. He explores the
universe in his TARDIS, a sentient time-travelling
space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British
police box, which was a common sight in Britain
in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a
succession of companions, the Doctor combats a variety
of foes while working to save civilisations and help
people in need.

The show is a significant part of British popular
culture,and elsewhere it has become a cult television
favourite. The show has influenced generations of
British television professionals, many of whom grew
up watching the series.Ý4¨ The programme originally
ran from 1963 to 1989. After an unsuccessful attempt
to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor
pilot in the form of a television film, the programme
was relaunched in 2005 by Russell T Davies who was
showrunner and head writer for the first five years
of its revival, produced in-house by BBC Wales in
Cardiff. The first series of the 21st century,
featuring Christopher Eccleston in the title role,
was produced by the BBC. Series two and three had
some development money contributed by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), which was credited
as a co-producer.Ý5¨ Doctor Who also spawned spin-offs
in multiple media, including Torchwood (2006 11) and
The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007 11), both created by
Russell T Davies; K-9 (2009 10); and a single pilot
episode of K-9 and Company (1981). There also have
been many spoofs and cultural references of the
character in other media.
