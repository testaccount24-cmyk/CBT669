 REXX function - Write and read data to named storage area.

 Current build: 005


 The purpose of the  program is to allow a REXX  program to store a
 string of  data in  common storage and  retrieve it  later, either
 from the same program or from another REXX program.

 REXXSTOR is reentrant and refreshable, so can reside in the LPAlib.

 REXXSTOR must be called as a function !

 REXXSTOR sets the following variables:
   REXXSTOR_RC  return code, not the same as the return value. See
                later for details.
   REXXSTOR_RS  reason code when return code is not 0.


 Syntax:
   action,name,data|variablename|length

   action is folded to uppercase internally
     A          Acquire a data block. This is sort-of a GETMAIN.
                Returns the address of the area.
                You can then use the STORAGE function to update
                and retrieve data.
     D          Delete (release) the storage.
     G          Get data from storage. If the 'variablename'
                parameter is used, then data will be written
                to the named variable, otherwise data will be in
                the return value.
     GA         Get the address of the storage area. Useful if
                you intend to use the STORAGE function to update
                or retrieve data. the same information is returned
                from the A action.
     GX         Same as G, plus the storage will be deleted (released)
     I          Get some information about the storage area.
     P          Write (put) data to storage. If the storageblock
                exists already, it will be overwritten.
     VER        Return the program name and build.

   name         Name of storage area. 1-8 bytes. Can be virtually
                anything. It is not folded to uppercase.

   data         Data to write to storage. Used with action P.

   length       Size of storage to acquire. Used with action A.

   variablename Name of variable to copy data to.


 Return:
   data if action is G or I
   address if action is A or GA
   ' '     if action is P, or if no data for action Gx


 Variable REXXSTOR_RC is set as follows:
    0     all ok
    1     missing or invalid parm 1
    2     missing or invalid parm 2
    3     missing or invalid parm 3
    8     no data in requested block
    9     unknown storage block
   11     set of large return value failed
   99     some other error, see reason variable


 Samples:

  cc   = REXXSTOR('a','stblk1','200') /* get block                   */
  va   = REXXSTOR('ga','stblk1')      /* get block address           */
  va   = REXXSTOR('d','stblk1')       /* remove block                */
  data = copies('a string ',100)
  cc   = REXXSTOR('p','stblk2',data)  /* write to store              */

 The STORAGE function can be used to store data directly in the data
 block, and retrieve data from the storage block, like this:

 Sample

  addr = REXXSTOR('a','stblk2',2000)       /* acquire storage         */
  cc   = Storage(addr,,'Kilroy was here')  /* write string to storage */
  resp = Storage(d2x(x2d(addr)+7),3)       /* get 'was'               */
