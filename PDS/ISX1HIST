History
004 2022/09/04  The screen stemvar can be indirectly named by
                by enclosing the name of a variable naming the
                stem in paranthesis i.e. *ISPDPX01 (pnlstem)
                or start with an ampersand i.e. *ISPDPX01 &pnlstem
005 2022/09/07  The screen stemvar is now accessed by REXX services,
                so the max width can be 120 instead of 8.
006 2022/09/17  Run as a function to get version info and to copy stack
                to stem.
